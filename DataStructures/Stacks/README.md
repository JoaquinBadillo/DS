# List Implementation of Stacks

## What is a stack?

A stack is a data strucutre that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) order. It works like a stack in real life, you only have access to the top item.

Stacks can be implemented as linked lists and arrays, the first one has the advantage that it only uses as much memory as needed and that it can be expanded. However, arrays have their advantages as well; for instance, you can store the data and save the memory required to store the pointers.
