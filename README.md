## What is this?

Data Structures are ways to store data in organized ways so that it can be used effectively. Effectiveness depends on your project of course, but one most be aware of common metrics of effectiveness, such as the time taken for an algorithm to finish or the memory it requires. These are known as the time and space complexities respectively, the only downsight is that modelling them mathematically is hard (they can depend on the system used for instance); so it is a common practice to use the order of growth (big omega, big theta and big o notations are great for this analysis).

In this repository I will add my implementations of multiple Data Strucutres in C++, my aim here is to use these data structures to solve common computer problems with algorithms and analyse their complexity.
